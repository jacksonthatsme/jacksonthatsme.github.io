        In 2017, I was tapped to lead design efforts for a brand new product at Kickstarter, our first since the initial platform launched in 2009. Under the name Drip, we would now offer our creators a flexible funding model that could support their lives more holistically, and foster a deeper engagement with their fanbase. It was our intention to launch as a standalone native app that would allow creators to share their process and lives in an easier, richer, and more continuous way.

        We started with the public-facing creator page. We wanted to create an enticing and expansive palate for a creator to show off every facet of their work, almost like a portfolio. We also wanted to design a format that would effectively pitch the project to interested backers and demonstrate the value of their support.

        This product, like Kickstarterâ€™s core product, is a two sided marketplace. We needed to create an engaging view that would actively update a backer on the latest from the creators that they support, reinforcing the value they were receiving from the exchange. We tried two versions: one that proudly presented each contribution on their own screen, and one that leveraged a traditional feed.

        One of the biggest insights we learned from existing creators was that it was that it took too much effort to put together a project update worth sharing with their backers. We wanted to alleviate this impression and create a compelling experience that would motivate creators to share with their backers more casually and frequently.
