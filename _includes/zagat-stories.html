        While we have been working on the new Zagat product, we wanted to find a way of re-establishing the Zagat brand as well as build a deeper report with the restaurant community. Due to resource constraints and an ambitious timeline, I knew we would need some outside help. I tapped Kevin Zweerink of <a target="_blank" href="https://currently.studio/">Currently.Studio</a> to lend his expertise.

        Earlier that year, we worked with <a target="_blank" href="https://franklyn.co/">Franklyn</a> to re-establish the visual branding, and this site would serve as its first major application. We created an editorial experience that honored the tradition of Zagat and thoughtfully structured our new content, all while providing high value opportunities for advertising and partnerships.
